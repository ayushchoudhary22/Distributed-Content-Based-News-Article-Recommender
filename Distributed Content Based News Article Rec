📰 Content-Based News Article Recommendation System

Big Data Project

📌 Project Overview

This project implements a Content-Based News Article Recommendation System that recommends relevant news articles to users based on the content similarity of articles rather than user behavior.

The system analyzes textual data from news articles using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and recommends articles that are most similar to a given article or user interest.

The project is designed using Big Data principles, making it scalable and efficient for handling large datasets.
